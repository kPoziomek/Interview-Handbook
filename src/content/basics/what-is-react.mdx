# What is React?

React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011 and released to the public in 2013. It follows the component-based approach, which helps in building reusable UI components. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.

## Core Features

### 1. JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript:

```jsx
const element = Hello, {name};
```

### 2. Virtual DOM

React creates a virtual representation of the UI in memory (Virtual DOM) and syncs it with the "real" DOM through a process called reconciliation.

### 3. Component-Based Architecture

React follows a component-based architecture. Components are like JavaScript functions that accept inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return Hello, {props.name};
}

// Usage

```

### 4. Unidirectional Data Flow

Data in React flows in one direction, from parent components to child components. This makes the application more predictable and easier to debug.

## Practice Example

Let's create a simple counter component that demonstrates React's state management:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (

      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>
        Decrement


  );
}
```

## Interview Questions

1. **What is React and why do we use it?**

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- It's declarative, efficient, and flexible
- Helps create interactive UIs that automatically update when data changes
- Component-based architecture promotes reusability

2. **What are the key features of React?**

- Virtual DOM
- JSX support
- Component-based architecture
- Unidirectional data flow
- Rich ecosystem and community

3. **What is the difference between React and Angular?**

- React is a library, Angular is a full framework
- React has a smaller learning curve
- React is more flexible in terms of architecture
- Angular includes more features out of the box

## Practice Exercise

Create a simple "Toggle" component that switches between "ON" and "OFF" states when clicked:

```jsx
// Your solution here
function Toggle() {
  // Implement the toggle functionality
}
```

Solution:

```jsx
function Toggle() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setIsOn(!isOn)}>
      {isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
    </button>
  );
}

```
