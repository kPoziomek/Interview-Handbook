## Practice Exercise

Create a Counter component that:

- Displays a number
- Has buttons to increment/decrement
- Includes a reset button
<Solution>
```jsx
    import { useState } from 'react';
    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      return (
        <div>
          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
            Click me
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
```
</Solution>

## Key points about this solution:
1. We use the useState hook to manage our counter state
2. We provide a button to increment the count
3. The count is displayed between the increment and decrement buttons
