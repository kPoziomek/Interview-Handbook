# Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Let's explore its core concepts.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Concepts

1. **Components**

   - Building blocks of React applications
   - Can be functional or class-based
   - Follow a unidirectional data flow

2. **JSX**
   ```jsx
   function Welcome(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
   }
   ```

## Practice Example

Try creating a simple component:

```jsx
// Your task: Create a button that changes its text when clicked
function ToggleButton() {
  // Your code here
}
```
