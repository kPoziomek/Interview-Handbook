# Understanding React Components

React components are the building blocks of any React application. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

## Function Components

Function components are the modern way to write React components:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return Hello, {props.name};
}
```

## Props and State

Components can accept props and manage state:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (

      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment

      </button>
  );
}
```

## Practice Exercise

Try creating a Toggle component that switches between "ON" and "OFF":

```jsx
// Your solution here
```

## Key Points to Remember

- Components must start with a capital letter
- Components can be nested
- Props are read-only
- State can be changed using setState or the state setter function
