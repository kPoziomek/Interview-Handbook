### What is the history behind React evolution?

  <b>See deep-dive answer</b>
  The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:

  **2010-2011: The Origins**

  - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that
  allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code
  - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks
  - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent
  server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes

  **2011-2012: Early Development**

  - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to
  React), inspired by XHP's component model
  - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with
  performance improvements
  - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of
  full page re-renders
  - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in
  2012

  **2013: Public Release**

  - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013
  - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the
  JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript

  **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**

  - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app
  development
  - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management
  - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications

  **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach
  of embedding XML-like syntax in code.

``` jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
