### What is JavaScript?

    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamic content updates, multimedia handling, animations, and user interface enhancements.

    JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially developed in just 10 days, it was originally named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java; the naming was a marketing strategy to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly and has become a versatile language used for both client-side and server-side development.
